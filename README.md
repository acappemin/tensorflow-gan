# tensorflow-gan
generative adversarial networks by tensorflow
## model.py and gan.py use full-connected layers in both generative and discriminative networks, figure_200.png shows 10 random results after 200 epochs of training
## cmodel.py and cgan.py use transpose convolution layer and convolution layer in generative and discriminative networks, cfigure_200.png shows 10 random results after 200 epochs of training
